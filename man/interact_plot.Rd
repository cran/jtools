}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A regression model of type \code{lm}, \code{glm},
\code{\link[survey]{svyglm}}, or \code{\link[lme4]{merMod}}. It should
contain the interaction of interest. Models from other classes may work as
well but are not officially supported.}

\item{pred}{The name of the predictor variable involved
in the interaction.}

\item{modx}{The name of the moderator variable involved
in the interaction.}

\item{modxvals}{For which values of the moderator should lines be plotted?
Default is \code{NULL}. If \code{NULL}, then the customary +/- 1 standard
deviation from the mean as well as the mean itself are used for continuous
moderators. If the moderator is a factor variable and \code{modxvals} is
\code{NULL}, each level of the factor is included. If
\code{"plus-minus"}, plots lines when the moderator is at +/- 1 standard
deviation without the mean.}

\item{mod2}{Optional. The name of the second moderator
variable involved in the interaction.}

\item{mod2vals}{For which values of the second moderator should the plot be
facetted by? That is, there will be a separate plot for each level of this
moderator. Defaults are the same as \code{modxvals}.}

\item{centered}{A vector of quoted variable names that are to be mean-centered. If
\code{NULL}, all non-focal predictors are centered. If not \code{NULL}, only
the user-specified predictors are centered. User can also use "none" or "all"
arguments. The response variable is not centered unless specified directly.}

\item{standardize}{Logical. Would you like to standardize the variables
that are centered? Default is \code{FALSE}, but if \code{TRUE} it will
standardize variables specified by the \code{centered} argument. Note that
non-focal predictors are centered when \code{centered = NULL}, its default.}

\item{n.sd}{How many standard deviations should be used if \code{standardize
= TRUE}? Default is 1, but some prefer 2.}

\item{plot.points}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, plots the actual data points as a
scatterplot on top of the interaction lines. If moderator is a factor, the dots
will be the same color as their parent factor.}

\item{interval}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, plots confidence/prediction intervals
the line using \code{\link[ggplot2]{geom_ribbon}}. Not supported for
\code{merMod} models.}

\item{int.type}{Type of interval to plot. Options are "confidence" or "prediction".
Default is confidence interval.}

\item{int.width}{How large should the interval be, relative to the standard error?
The default, .95, corresponds to roughly 1.96 standard errors and a .05 alpha
level for values outside the range. In other words, for a confidence interval,
.95 is analogous to a 95\% confidence interval.}

\item{outcome.scale}{For nonlinear models (i.e., GLMs), should the outcome
variable be plotted on the link scale (e.g., log odds for logit models) or
the original scale (e.g., predicted probabilities for logit models)? The
default is \code{"response"}, which is the original scale. For the link
scale, which will show straight lines rather than curves, use
\code{"link"}.}

\item{set.offset}{For models with an offset (e.g., Poisson models), sets a
offset for the predicted values. All predicted values will have the same
offset. By default, this is set to 1, which makes the predicted values a
proportion.}

\item{x.label}{A character object specifying the desired x-axis label. If \code{NULL},
the variable name is used.}

\item{y.label}{A character object specifying the desired x-axis label. If \code{NULL},
the variable name is used.}

\item{pred.labels}{A character vector of 2 labels for the predictor if it is
a 2-level factor or a continuous variable with only 2 values. If \code{NULL},
the default, the factor labels are used.}

\item{modx.labels}{A character vector of labels for each level of the moderator values,
provided in the same order as the \code{modxvals} argument. If \code{NULL},
the values themselves are used as labels unless \code{modxvals} is also \code{NULL}.
In that case, "+1 SD" and "-1 SD" are used.}

\item{mod2.labels}{A character vector of labels for each level of the 2nd moderator
values, provided in the same order as the \code{mod2vals} argument. If \code{NULL},
the values themselves are used as labels unless \code{mod2vals} is also \code{NULL}.
In that case, "+1 SD" and "-1 SD" are used.}

\item{main.title}{A character object that will be used as an overall title for the
plot. If \code{NULL}, no main title is used.}

\item{legend.main}{A character object that will be used as the title that appears
above the legend. If \code{NULL}, the name of the moderating variable is used.}

\item{color.class}{Any palette argument accepted by
\code{\link[ggplot2]{scale_colour_brewer}}. Default is "Set2" for factor moderators,
"Blues" for +/- SD and user-specified \code{modxvals} values.}

\item{line.thickness}{How thick should the plotted lines be? Default is 1.1;
ggplot's default is 1.}

\item{vary.lty}{Should the resulting plot have different shapes for each line
in addition to colors? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\value{
The functions returns a \code{ggplot} object, which can be treated like
  a user-created plot and expanded upon as such.
}
\description{
\code{interact_plot()} plots regression lines at user-specified levels of a moderator
variable to explore interactions. The plotting is done with \code{ggplot2} rather than
base graphics, which some similar functions use.
}
\details{
This function provides a means for plotting conditional effects for the
  purpose of exploring interactions in the context of regression. You must have the
  package \code{ggplot2} installed to benefit from these plotting functions.

  The function is designed for two and three-way interactions. For
   additional terms, the
  \code{\link[effects]{effects}} package may be better suited to the task.

  This function supports nonlinear and generalized linear models and by
  default will plot them on
  their original scale (\code{outcome.scale = "response"}).

  While mixed effects models from \code{lme4} are supported, only the fixed
  effects are plotted. \code{lme4} does not provide confidence intervals,
  so they are not supported with this function either.

fit <- lm(Income ~ HSGrad + Murder*Illiteracy,

interact_plot(model = fit, pred = Murder,
  modx = Illiteracy)

# Using interval feature
fit <- lm(accel ~ mag*dist, data=attenu)
interact_plot(fit, pred = mag, modx = dist, interval = TRUE,
  int.type = "confidence", int.width = .8)
