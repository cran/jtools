\title{Scale and/or center regression inputs, including from survey designs, by dividing by 2 SD}
\usage{
gscale(x = NULL, binary.inputs = "center", data = NULL, n.sd = 2,
  center.only = FALSE, scale.only = FALSE, weights = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector to be rescaled, or a vector of variable names. If none provided, but data
frame or \code{svydesign} object is, all columns will be processed and returned.}

\item{binary.inputs}{Options for binary variables. Default is \code{center};
\code{0/1} keeps original scale; \code{-0.5/0.5} rescales 0 as -0.5 and 1 as 0.5;
\code{center} subtracts the mean; and \code{full} subtracts the mean and
divides by 2 sd.}

\item{data}{A data frame or survey design. Only needed if you would like to
rescale multiple variables at once. If \code{x = NULL}, all columns will
be rescaled. Otherwise, \code{x} should be a vector of variable names. If
\code{x} is a numeric vector, this argument is ignored.}

\item{n.sd}{By how many standard deviations should the variables be divided by?
Default is 2, as in \pkg{arm}'s \code{\link[arm]{rescale}}. Choosing 1 would
make for a more typical standardization scheme.}

\item{center.only}{A logical value indicating whether you would like to mean-center
the values, but not scale them.}

\item{scale.only}{A logical value indicating whether you would like to scale
the values, but not mean-center them.}

\item{weights}{A vector of weights equal in length to \code{x}. If iterating
over a data frame, the weights will need to be equal in length to all the
columns to avoid errors. You may need to remove missing values before using
the weights.}
}
\description{
\code{gscale()} standardizes variables by dividing them by 2 standard deviations
and mean-centering them by default. It contains options for handling binary
variables separately. \code{gscale()} is a fork of \code{\link[arm]{rescale}}
from the \pkg{arm} package---the key feature difference is that
\code{gscale()} will perform the same functions for variables in
\code{\link[survey]{svydesign}} objects. \code{gscale()} is also more
user-friendly in that it is more flexible in how it accepts input.
}
\details{
This function is adapted from the \code{\link[arm]{rescale}} function of
the \pkg{arm} package. It is named \code{gscale()} after the
popularizer of this scaling method, Andrew \strong{G}elman. By default, it
works just like \code{rescale}. But it contains many additional options and
can also accept multiple types of input without breaking a sweat.

Only numeric variables are altered when in a data.frame or survey design.
Character variables, factors, etc. are skipped.

For those dealing with survey data, if you provide a \code{survey.design} object
you can rest assured that the mean-centering and scaling is performed
with help from the \code{\link[survey]{svymean}} and
\code{\link[survey]{svyvar}} functions, respectively. It was among the primary
motivations for creating this function. \code{gscale()} will not center or
scale the weights variables defined in the survey design unless the user
specifically requests them in the \code{x =} argument.

\examples{

x <- rnorm(100, 2, 1)
x2 <- rbinom(100, 1, .5)

# Basic use
gscale(x)
# Normal standardization
gscale(x, n.sd = 1)
# Scale only
gscale(x, scale.only = TRUE)
# Center only
gscale(x, center.only = TRUE)
# Binary inputs
gscale(x2, binary.inputs = "0/1")
gscale(x2, binary.inputs = "full") # treats it like a continous var
gscale(x2, binary.inputs = "-0.5/0.5") # keep scale, center at zero
gscale(x2, binary.inputs = "center") # mean center it

# Data frame as input
gscale(data = mtcars, binary.inputs = "-0.5/0.5") # loops through each numeric column
# Specified vars in data frame
gscale(c("hp", "wt", "vs"), data = mtcars, binary.inputs = "center")

wts <- runif(100, 0, 1)
mtcars$weights <- wts[1:32]

# Weighted inputs
gscale(x, weights = wts)
# If using a weights column of data frame, give its name
gscale(data = mtcars, weights = weights) # will skip over mtcars$weights
# If using a weights column of data frame, can still select variables
gscale(x = c("hp", "wt", "vs"), data = mtcars, weights = weights)

# Survey designs
library(survey)
data(api)
## Create survey design object
dstrat <- svydesign(id = ~1,strata = ~stype, weights = ~pw, data = apistrat,
                     fpc=~fpc)
dstrat$variables$binary <- rbinom(200, 1, 0.5) # Creating test binary variable

gscale(data = dstrat, binary.inputs = "-0.5/0.5")
gscale(c("api00","meals","binary"), data = dstrat, binary.inputs = "-0.5/0.5")
